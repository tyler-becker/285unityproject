// here is the pause code for everyone. Currently it uses Space Bar to pause the game
// We have a pause menu now - since we got some flak for not having an indicator. Now we have a pause menu that can
// show high score(when that works) , can quit and goto beginging of game and can resum.

// we can use the same code for the end game scene as well. All that scence has is a menu with return to main and high scores
// with the resume game button removed. If we decided to do something fancy with teh end game we can create another
//page. Just label then scence as GameOver1.unity and when we pull it  use Application.LoadLevel("GameOver1");
