// For this we need to make gameObjects to place on top of the terrain so we can control where to put Towers
// I saw there was a way to do this without using gameObjects that elminates overhead but it doesn't make sense to me.
// So we will do it the cluncky way - this is called Prim's Algorithm(wikipedia)
// We will not be sure if this works until later on when we get the towers rolling - but when it is in Unity it shows a grid when
// the gameObject color is changed. So i dunno

public class GridScript : MonoBehaviour {
  public Transform CellPrefab;
  public Vector3 Size;
  
  void Start() {
    CreateGrid();
  }
  
  // this actually looks like stuff we are during in school lol
  void CreateGrid() {
    for (int x = 0; x < Size.x; x++) {
      for (int z = 0; z < Size.z; z++) {
      Instantiate(CellPrefab, new Vector3(x, 0, 0), Quaternion.identity);
      }
    }
  }
